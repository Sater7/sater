	<h2>How We Use Personal Data We Collect</h2>
	<p>The personal data we collect may come directly from you or we may obtain it from other sources, such as our service providers and resellers.</p>
	<p>We want you to understand the types of personal data we process and if we do not obtain your personal data directly from you, the source we used, and the specific data collected.</p>
	<p>We collect personal data for these reasons: to process the purchase of a product or service; to provision the product or service to you; and for the legitimate interests of us. We use no more than the minimum amount of personal data needed for the processing. We also use personal data only when the processing is necessary for our or our third party’s legitimate interests.</p>
	<p>When our use of your personal data is based on the legitimate interests of us and is compatible with the provision of service, you have the right to object. In some cases, you may exercise your right to object directly, for example you may unsubscribe to email marketing messages or you may choose to turn off data use in the applicable product settings; in other cases you may notify us here: sater.pr@gmail.com and we will investigate the grounds relating to your particular situation.</p>
	<p>In the following sections, we explain the personal data we collect. Please be mindful that some of the categories may collect the same personal data.</p>
	<h2>Marketing</h2>
	<p>To be able to offer you our app for free, we show third party ads within your mobile apps through popular ad networks, which are listed below. We display an AdChoices logo on top of every ad. You can tap the icon to learn more about the ad network.</p>
	<p>To enable the ad, we embed a third-party software development kit (SDK) for these ads. The SDK code is provided by third party ad agencies or networks.</p>
	<p>Data of our mobile users remain anonymous to us and to the third party ad agencies. However, the ad agencies’ SDK code will collect data to tailor ads to you, such as the third-party apps you installed on your device, your Android advertising identifier, your IP Address, your device's operating system details and MAC address, and other statistical and technical information. You can find more information in each network’s privacy policy, the link to which we are also including in the overview below.</p>
